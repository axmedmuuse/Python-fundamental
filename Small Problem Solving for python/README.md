1. Control Flow
Control flow refers to the order in which the program's code executes. The primary control flow structures in Python are:

    Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

    Loops (for, while)

    Control Statements (break, continue, pass)


2. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and making it more modular.


3. Lambda functions 
are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword.



4. Error Handling
Sometimes, you need to handle errors gracefully. Python provides try, except, finally for this purpose.


Conclusion
Understanding control flow and functions is crucial for effective problem-solving in Python. By mastering these concepts, you can write more efficient, readable, and modular code. Practice these examples and try to create your own problems to solve using these techniques!
